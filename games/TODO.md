-make the square move in a predictable pattern
i.e. straight line -- or map out moves to get
to one side to get a feel for what it 
takes to move thorugh the maze
-done

-make it so if it hits a wall the game 
starts over back at the original spot

make the walls end_rects a list of end
rects

-if I get it to start over make it learn
from the previous experience (using the 
left/right hand rule)

I want to research some algorithms 
for finding a way to solve the maze
problem and then do a write up 
on my progress

left-hand rule
-start
-reach the end? 
 -yes - end
 -no - next
is there a wall to the left?
 -yes - rotate ccw (left) move forward 
 -no - next
is there a cell in the front free?
 -yes - move forward, jump to top
 -no - rotate cw (right)


pledge algorithm

tremaux algorithm

I want to figure out why the algorithm 
is not saving data to the new dataframe
